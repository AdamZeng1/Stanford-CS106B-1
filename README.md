# Stanford CS 106B
## Programming Abstractions with C++
This folder includes the files and projects that I completed in Stanford `CS 106B class` (summer 2015).<br>
Each project focuses on a certain aspect of programming abstraction, while requires employing other capabilities of a programming language (C++, here).<br><br>
For further information on the projects, including test cases, please refer to [CS 106B: Programming Abstractions (C++) 
Summer 2015](http://stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs106b/cs106b.1158/homework.shtml).
