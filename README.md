# Stanford CS 106B
## Programming Abstractions with C++
This folder includes the files and projects that I completed in Stanford `CS 106B class` (summer 2015).<br>
Each project focuses on a certain aspect of programming abstraction, while requires employing other capabilities of a programming language (C++, here).
