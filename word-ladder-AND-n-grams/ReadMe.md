## ASsignment 2: Word Ladder and N-Grams<br>
This folder contains the project description and the submitted solution to the problem.<br><br>
This assignment focuses on selecting and deploying proper data structures (HashMap, HashSet, Lexicon, Map, Queue, Set, Stack, ...) to in designing an efficient application in C++.<br><br>
This project consists of two subprojects. In the first part, a word ladder from an aribitrary to another arbitrary word is designed. In the second part, the program should read a large text, arbitrary number N, and the number of words. Then, it generates a paragrap which has the requested number of words and is composed of N-grams.
